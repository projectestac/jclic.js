[JClic.js](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic.js) is an HTML5 player of [JClic](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) activities. See a [demo](https://clic.xtec.cat/projects/demo_eng/jclic.js/index.html) on how it works.

## JClic and JClic-repo

[JClic](http://clic.xtec.cat) is a free software project from the [Catalan Educational Telematic Network](http://www.xtec.cat) (XTEC) for creating various types of interactive activities such as associations, puzzles, text activities, crosswords or puzzles, from elements of text, graphics and multimedia.

The program includes an authoring tool to create activities, a player and a reporting system that stores the results obtained by students. All these components, along with some guides and tutorials on how to create activities, are available in the [clicZone](http://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/download.htm).

JClic is a Java application that runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Full [source code](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic) and [documentation](http://projectestac.github.io/jclic/) are available on GitHub.

Many teachers from different countries have used JClic to create interactive materials for a wide variety of levels, subjects, languages and curriculum areas. Some of these materials have been collected in a huge [library](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo) created with [jclic-repo](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic-repo), another open source project that will facilitate the publication of collections of JClic projects in static web hosting services.

## How to build JClic.js

JClic.js uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) modules encapsulated in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages. First of all, you must have Node.js (which includes 'npm') [installed](https://nodejs.org/download/) on your system.


To install the required packages, just go to the project's root directory and write:

```
npm ci
```

This will install jQuery, Webpack and other needed components into `node_modules`

To build jclic.js, just invoke:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate the main file `dist/jclic.min.js` (along with other files useful for development)

To test and debug the resulting bundle, launch the webpack dev server:

```
npm start
```

This will launch a local HTTP server allowing to choose between pages in development mode (bundle build dynamically by [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)) and in production mode (serving the latest build on `/dist`)

Full API documentation of jclic.js is available at: http://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js/doc

The project is also available as an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jclic) package.

* [clipboard-polyfill](https://github.com/lgarron/clipboard-polyfill) to copy reports data into the user's clipboard
* [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next) to deal with messages translated into different languages
* [script.js](https://github.com/ded/script.js) to read JClic projects from local file systems as JSONP
* [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) to dynamically load web fonts as needed

The build process of JClic.js makes use of:
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (the package manager of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)) to build, install, update and track package dependencies
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to check for errors and lint the source code
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle all components together
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to make it also compatible with old versions of some browsers
* [terser](https://terser.org/) to minimize the size of the final deliverable script
* [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) and [ink-bootstrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) to build the [API docs](http://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js/doc)
