#How to translate JClic.js

[JClic.js](https://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js) makes use of a small set of strings, mostly placed in button tooltips and user reports.

You can contribute to the project translating these texts into your language, or helping to revise the translations done by other people. To do this just go to the [jclic.js project in Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/jclic/jclicjs/) and join or start session. If your language or variant is not yet on the list, click on the plus sign at the top right and select `Start new translation`.

Translations can be done directly on Weblate or locally editing a [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) file using [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/).

Thank you for collaborating in this free software project!
