### v2.0.1 (Not yet released)
#### Breaking changes
- JClic projects can be now encapsulated in JSON format (files with extension `.jclic.json`). Current files in XML format (`.jclic`) will be still supported, but JSON will be the default format from now. Both formats can also be packaged in ZIP files (files of type `.jclic.zip` and `.scorm.zip`). This will simplify the development of the upcoming new project _JClic Author HTML5_.
- Static factory methods in classes with multiple descendants.
- New methods `getAttributes` and `setAttributes` in core classes, used to serialize and de-serialize projects data.
- Drop Bower support.

#### Bug fixes
- Check for numeric digits in _Arith_ activity answers before converting them to numbers.
- Page reloads when entering text to the first question on _Written Answer_ activities (jQuery related)- Use 'idempotent-babel-polyfill' instead of 'babel-polyfill' as a workaround to [this issue](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/issues/401), causing problems in JClic module for Moodle.
- Use the `box-sizing` CSS attribute to compute the real with of the counters area in `DefaultSkin`.
- Audio recorder features now enabled for all modern browsers using [MediaDevices.getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) instead of the deprecated method [navigator.getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia).
- Find [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) with vendor prefix in MIDI audio player (needed for Safari)
- Unset `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` attributes in custom buttons
- Accessible components for `canvas` regions should always be created since [`HitRegions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/addHitRegion) have been deprecated. Also, [`CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawFocusIfNeeded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawFocusIfNeeded) should be called on each call to `updateContent` on `ActiveBox` objects, not just at creation time.

#### Improvements
- Updated core components to their latest versions.
- Use of `package-lock` instead of `npm-shinkwrap` to lock version dependencies.
- Restored semicolons in all source files
- Deliverable files are now minimized with [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) intead of [Uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)
- Full screen mode now using direct calls to the [Full Screen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) instead of [screenfull](https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenfull)
- Upgraded components
- Max audio recording time increased to 180"
- Provide visual feedback while recording audio
- Map JDK logical fonts ("Dialog", "Serif", etc.) to [HTML5 generic font family names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)
- Improved experience with screen readers like [ChromeVox](https://www.chromevox.com/) and [Chromevox Classic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox-classic-extensi/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn) 

### v1.1.11 (2019-02-11)
#### Bug fixes
- Corrected a bug in `automation/arith/Arith.js` that affected operations with decimals with _do not carry_ option.

#### Improvements
- Numeric expressions generated by "Arith" (the mental arithmetics moduleof JClic) use now dot or comma as a decimal separator, depending on the browser's "locale" settings.
- The new `numericContent` activity flag is used by _Arith_ activities to check written answers. So expressions like "0.1", "0.10" and "00,100" (with dot or comma) are considered equivalent.

### v1.1.10 (2019-01-23)
#### Bug fixes
- Explicit call to `HTMLAudioElement.load` in `bags/MediaBagElement.build` to avoid the lack of `canplay` events
  when just setting the `src` attribute in Chrome on Android < 7. Now JClic always try to load audio content, also in Android!

### v1.1.9 (2018-10-15)
#### Improvements
- Basic support for MIDI files: Only one musical instrument (acoustic grand piano) is dynamically loaded
  and used for all tracks, in a single MIDI channel schema. No percussion sounds on channel 10. This feature must be
  improved on the future, but currently covers the basic necessities of most musical activities.

### v1.1.8 (2018-09-12)
#### Improvements
- JClic.js is now also available also in Polish, thanks to Waldemar Stoczkowski!
- Build scripts updated to work with [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io)

### v1.1.7 (2018-06-20)
#### Bug fixes
- Allow projects to have multiple custom skins defined in XML files

### v1.1.5 (2018-05-17)
#### Improvements
- Use of [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) to polyfill, transpile and build the main distributable file `jclic.min.js`

#### Bug fixes
- Avoid playing disabled event sounds
- Declare the `document` member in `Activity.prototype`
- Use of `Element.getAttribute` instead of `style.attributes.*`

### v1.1.4 (2018-02-27)
#### Improvements
- Full implementation of JClic "legacy custom skins" (see v1.1.3) including counters and progress animations. This feature makes use of CSS [animation](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation) and [grid layout](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), so please update your web browser!

### v1.1.3 (2018-02-20)
#### Improvements
- Improved responsiveness: Now skin elements are reduced to 2/3 or 1/2 of its original size when running on mobile devices with small screens.
- Basic functionality of JClic "legacy custom skins" (based on XML files) are now supported in browsers compatible with [CSS Grid Layout](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). This feature is currently used in many great JClic projects created by [Imma Palahí](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo/index.html?lang=ca&author=Imma%20Palahi).

#### Bug fixes
- Solved a bug in Menu.js
- Check for null values on AUDIO_BUFFERS and mbe.data

### v1.1.0 (2018-02-08)
#### Improvements
- All the code has been updated to [ECMAScript6](http://es6-features.org) (ES6), taking advantage of new JavaScript features (classes, constants, arrow functions, array methods...) in modern browsers. The main file `jclic.min.js` will maintain compability with older browsers for some time, since it is transpiled to ES5 thanks to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
- Updated test files.
- All media is now played at the end of the current event handling, so it's not blocked by mobile browsers (see [this thread](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178297) for more information about this issue)
- New JSDoc-Bootstrap theme for the [API Docs](http://projectestac.github.io/jclic.js/doc/index.html)

#### Bug fixes
- Catch `Enter` key in written answer activities.
- Disable drop-down lists at the end of text activities

### v1.0.5 (2018-02-05)
#### Bug fixes
- WrittenAnswer activities: always update the alternative content off cells when done

### v1.0.4 (2018-01-22)
#### Improvements
- Text activities can now display pop-up windows and play helper sounds of targets, as in JClic Player.

#### Bug fixes
- Avoid false positives with empty responses in text activities.

### v1.0.3 (2018-01-15)
#### Bug fixes
- Check always the ordering of cascading styles text activities.
- Always detect carriage returns in activities of type "fill-in blanks".

### v1.0.2 (2017-12-12)
#### Bug fixes
- Corrected a bug detected in cell placement inside ActiveBoxBag, affecting some exchange puzzles with gigsaw and other special shapers.

### v1.0.1 (2017-11-10)
#### Improvements
- New startup parameter `returnAsExit` treats `ActivitySequence` elements of type `return` as if they where of type `exit`, only when `PlayerHistory.sequenceStack` is empty.

### v1.0.0 (2017-10-18)
#### Improvements
- Major version number updated to 1.x to be compliant with [semver](http://semver.org/). With this change, the project goes from _Initial development_ (0.x) to _Public API_ (1.x).
- New class `report/SessionStorageReporter`, storing report results in [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) or [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
- jclic.js is also available at [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jclic.js), thanks to [Peter Dave Hello](https://github.com/PeterDaveHello) and [LboAnn](https://github.com/extend1994).

### v0.1.49 (2017-09-01)
#### Improvements
- New NPM scripts to build, debug and launch jclic.js, now based on [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) instead of [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). See README.md for more information.

### v0.1.48 (2017-07-21)
#### Improvements
- Implemented the type of activity "Menu", used in legacy JClic libraries. Useful for JClic libraries hosted on school servers: now they can be served as HTML resources just placing an `index.html` in the root folder pointing to the `library.jclic` file, like in [this example](https://clic.xtec.cat/pub/2005/index.html).

### v0.1.47 (2017-05-16)
#### Improvements
- Updated French translation, thanks to [Heluga Valka](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/Heluga/)

#### Bug fixes
- Control of the maximum display time of previous screen in text activities. This JClic feature was unimplemented until now. Probably closes #12.
- Backslashes in active media parameters and file names are now always converted to forward slashes. This avoids problems with chaining in big projects distributed among multiple folders.
- Set default value of `navButtonsAlways` to `false`. Closes #11.
- Avoid creating `AccessibleElement` when canvas has no surface.
- Double-check the existence of `ActiveBoxBag` elements before using them.

- Put stylesheets within shadow-root when in shadow DOM.

### v0.1.46 (2017-04-24)
#### Improvements
- Use HTTPS as defaul protocol in `TCPReporter`.
- Set an empty string as default value in dropdown lists on text activities.

#### Bug fixes
- Flush always pending tasks in `TCPReporter` before exiting.

### v0.1.45 (2017-03-20)
#### Improvements
- Display a progress bar (in addition to the rotating animation) while loading project media elements.

#### Bug fixes
- Transform full activity class names to `@className` expressions, so projects using this naming schema (like [GeoClic](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo/index.html?prj=geoclien)) can now make use of JClic.js.

### v0.1.44 (2017-03-15)
#### Improvements
- `EmptySkin` has been implemented and is now used as initial player skin.
- JClic java applets generated through `jclicplugin.js` are now always loaded as JClic.js HTML5 elements. This change has been motivated by the fact that [Firefox 52](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/52.0/releasenotes/) has dropped support for Java applets.
- Updated NPM components.

#### Bug fixes
- Check `AWT.WebFont` to avoid conflicts with other webfont loader packages already loaded.
- Build always a skin for `JClicPlayer`, even when the requested one does no exist.
- Force main container width and height when inside a `TD`.
- Avoid incorrect placement of inner elements when parent container has the `align` attribute defined.

### v0.1.43 (2017-02-28)
#### Bug fixes
- Allow animated GIFs also over gradients.
- Solved incorrect startup of "complete text" activities with previous screen.
- Place "check" button always anchored at bottom of text activities.

- Solved problems when rounding and ceiling integers in Arith.
- Avoid calling `buildAccessibleElements` on null panels

### v0.1.42 (2017-02-20)
#### Miscellaneous
- Export third-party NPM packages in a new member of `Utils` called `pkg`, so external scripts can make use of it through the global vriable `JClicObject`. This change was needed to implement downloading of JClic projects in [JClic Repo](https://github.com/projectestac/jclic-repo).

### v0.1.41 (2017-02-13)
#### Improvements
- Use of [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) polyfill to support `Promise` in IE11 and other outdated browsers.
- Explicit loading of fonts included in JClic projects. The `name` attribute of media elements is now used as `font-family` value.

#### Bug fixes
- Resolve dependencies and browserless issues affecting `listProjectContents.js` (in `test/nodejs`)

#### Miscellaneous
- Specific developer's settings for [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), besides [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/).
- Use of [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) instead of [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). Same functionality, but better integration with [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### v0.1.40 (2016-11-23)
#### Bug fixes
- Don't stop media on mouseup events
- Play sounds also in grid B, when available

### v0.1.39 (2016-11-11)
#### Improvements

### v0.1.38 (2016-11-02)
#### Bug fixes
- Treat 'x' as zero when parsing data for Arith operators, thus avoiding "NaN" errors in some activities.
- Avoid keyboard hiding on tablets when in written answer activities.

- Experimental use of [HTML canvas hit regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Hit_regions_and_accessibility). In order to use it, flags `ExperimentalCanvasFeatures` (Chrome) or `canvas.hitregions.enabled` (Firefox) must be enabled. Checked with [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/)

#### Code cleaning and documentation

- More strict settings when checking code with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)

### v0.1.31 (2016-07-20)
#### Bug fixes
- Apply `JClicPlayer.defaultSkin` only when `JClicProject.skin` is not specified

#### Improvements
- Implemented support for SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. Now JClic reports global score and session time when a SCORM API is detected.
- New method to calculate scores for SCORM: now _"partial score"_ refers to the score average of all played activities and _"global score"_ multiplies it by the ratio between the number of activities played at least once and the total number of activities in the project. For example, when playing a project with 20 activities, a student that has successfully finished only one activity will have a _partial score_ of 100%, but its _global score_ will be only 5%. When all activities are played at least once, global and partial scores have the same value.
- New logging system. Verbosity on the JavaScript console can now be adjusted with a 'logLevel' parameter that can have one of the values: _all_, _trace_, _debug_, _info_, _warn_, _error_ and _none_. Default is: _warn_.
